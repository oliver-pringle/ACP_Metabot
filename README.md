# ACP_Metabot — Marketplace Discovery for ACP

A meta-bot for the Virtuals Protocol ACP marketplace. Indexes every offering
across all agents, embeds them, and exposes four ACP offerings:

| Name              | Price        | What it does                                                                  |
|-------------------|--------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `search`          | 0.01 USDC    | Hybrid BM25 + dense semantic search; returns ranked offerings + a `bestMatch` flag when score ≥ 0.7. Filters by `priceMaxUsdc`, `chain`, `minReputation`, `freshness`. |
| `composeStack`    | 0.50 USDC    | LLM-curated multi-offering stack for a buyer's stated use case.               |
| `watchOffering`   | 0.50 USDC    | Standing semantic search delivered via buyer-supplied HTTPS webhook over a 1–30 day window. |
| `agentReputation` | 0.05 USDC    | On-chain behavioural reputation (0–100) for an agent: completion rate, dispute rate, recency, 30-day throughput, avg response time. Cached 24h. Includes a 30-day daily trajectory in the deliverable. |

Public read-only sibling endpoint: `GET /v1/agentReputationHistory?agent=<addr>&days=<1-90>` returns day-by-day trajectory without a paid hire.

Built off the BasicBot boilerplate. Live on Base mainnet. Design specs:

- `docs/design.md` — overall architecture
- `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-04-26-watchoffering-design.md` — watchOffering spec
- `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-04-28-agent-reputation-v2-design.md` — agentReputation v2 (behavioural) spec
- `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-04-30-sharper-core-engine-design.md` — hybrid search + fielded filters + reputation trajectory (v1.2)

```

The TS sidecar speaks ACP v2 (the SDK is Node-only). The C# API holds the
indexer, vector search, Claude composer, and watch poller. All inter-service
calls require an `X-API-Key` header; only `/health` is unauth'd.

The sidecar polls its own queries against the indexed corpus every
`intervalHours` and POSTs new matches to a buyer-supplied HTTPS webhook
for `watchOffering`.

## Prerequisites

- .NET 10 SDK
- Node.js 22+
- Docker / Docker Compose (for production)
- A **Voyage AI** API key (for embeddings) — https://www.voyageai.com/
- An **Anthropic** API key (for `composeStack`) — https://console.anthropic.com/

## Local development

Two `.env` files are required. The shared `INTERNAL_API_KEY` authenticates
the sidecar's calls into the C# API. Generate it with `openssl rand -hex 32`
and use the same value in both files.

```bash
# Project root .env
VOYAGE_API_KEY=pa-...
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...
INTERNAL_API_KEY=<openssl rand -hex 32>
```

```bash
# acp-v2/.env
ACP_WALLET_ADDRESS=0x...
ACP_WALLET_ID=...
ACP_SIGNER_PRIVATE_KEY=...
ACP_BUILDER_CODE=
ACP_CHAIN=base
ACP_METABOT_API_URL=http://localhost:5000
INTERNAL_API_KEY=<same value as above>
```

Three terminals:

```bash
# Terminal 1 — C# API on http://localhost:5000
cd ACP_Metabot.Api
export VOYAGE_API_KEY=pa-...
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...
export INTERNAL_API_KEY=...
dotnet run
```

```bash
# Terminal 2 — ACP sidecar (watches for TS changes)
cd acp-v2
npm install
npm run dev
```

```bash
# Terminal 3 — manually drive the API (optional)
# /health is open; everything else needs X-API-Key
curl http://localhost:5000/health
curl -H "X-API-Key: $INTERNAL_API_KEY" -X POST http://localhost:5000/search \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"query":"close a trading position on a perp DEX","limit":5}'
```

## Marketplace data source

Default is `Indexer:Source=acp-api`, which paginates the upstream
`https://acpx.virtuals.io/` endpoint. A `json-file` source is also
supported for offline dev — see `docs/technical-specifications.md`.

## Provisioning the agent

1. Go to https://app.virtuals.io/acp/agents/, create or upgrade an agent to V2.
2. From the **Signers** tab, copy `walletId` and `signerPrivateKey`.
3. Paste into `acp-v2/.env`:
   ```
   ACP_WALLET_ADDRESS=0x...
   ACP_WALLET_ID=...
   ACP_SIGNER_PRIVATE_KEY=...
   ACP_CHAIN=base
   ```
4. Register all four offerings (`search`, `composeStack`, `watchOffering`,
   `agentReputation`) on app.virtuals.io. Print the registration JSON with:
   ```bash
   cd acp-v2 && npm run print-offerings
   ```

## Production (Linux / Docker)

The canonical deploy target is **Oracle Cloud Ampere A1 (ARM, free tier)
running Ubuntu 22.04**. Full runbook: **[`docs/deploy/oracle-cloud.md`](docs/deploy/oracle-cloud.md)**.

Quick version once the VM is bootstrapped:

```bash
git clone <your-repo> ~/ACP_Metabot
cd ~/ACP_Metabot/ACP_Metabot
# Create .env (root) and acp-v2/.env from the templates above; chmod 600.
docker compose up -d --build
docker compose logs -f
```

The API has no published ports — only the sidecar talks to it on the
internal `acp-metabot` bridge network. SQLite persists to
`./data/acp_metabot.db` on the host.

`acp-metabot-api` also joins the external bridge `acp-shared` (created
once with `docker network create acp-shared`). This allows ACP_DeFiEval's
deep-eval tier to call `POST /agentReputation` on `acp-metabot-api:5000`
directly, authenticated with `X-Api-Key: $INTERNAL_API_KEY`. No new
endpoint was added; only cross-bot reachability was enabled in v1.1.

## Operator telemetry

Every request is recorded into the `request_log` table by an ASP.NET
middleware that runs after the rate limiter (so 429s are captured) and
before the X-API-Key check (so 401s on internal paths are captured).
Provider failures (Voyage / Claude) are tagged as `provider_error =
"voyage_<status>"` / `"claude_<status>"` via typed exceptions.

Five operator-only `GET /metrics/*` endpoints (X-API-Key gated, same as
`/index/stats`) expose the data. They are NOT reachable through the
public Caddy gateway — exec into the api container or SSH-tunnel:

```bash
# From the droplet:
docker compose exec acp-metabot-api curl -s \
  -H "X-API-Key: $INTERNAL_API_KEY" \
  http://localhost:5000/metrics/summary?days=7 | jq

# Other endpoints:
.../metrics/timeseries?days=7&granularity=hour
.../metrics/endpoints?days=7
.../metrics/top?dim=query&days=7   (or dim=agent)
.../metrics/errors?days=1&limit=100
```

The `summary` response includes `metricsDropped` — non-zero means the
in-process bounded channel (4096) was overflowed, the oldest events
were dropped, and you should look into bumping capacity or batch size
in `MetricsWriterService`.

Source classification (`source` column on `request_log`):
- `mcp_plugin` — `/v1/*` requests with `User-Agent: acp-find-plugin/<ver>`.
- `public_other` — any other `/v1/*` traffic (curl, browsers, other MCP clients).
- `internal` — non-`/v1/*` traffic (sidecar, cross-bot). The `X-Caller`
  header (e.g. `sidecar`, `defieval`) is captured into `caller_id` for
  per-bot breakdown without a schema change.

Retention: raw rows 14 days, hourly rollup 90 days, daily rollup
forever. Hourly rollup happens at minute 5 of every hour; daily rollup
+ prune at 03:00 UTC.

For the metric → scaling-lever mapping, see [`docs/runbook-scaling.md`](docs/runbook-scaling.md).

## Security posture

- **`X-API-Key` between sidecar and C# API.** Required on every endpoint
  except `/health`. Fail-closed if missing or wrong.
- **SSRF guard on `webhookUrl`.** Resolves and rejects RFC1918, loopback,
  link-local (incl. cloud metadata `169.254.169.254`), CGNAT, multicast,
  reserved, and IPv6 site-/link-local/unique-local/multicast. Re-validated
  before every webhook delivery to defend against DNS rebinding.
- **Evaluator-zero enforcement.** Seller refuses jobs with
  `evaluatorAddress != 0x0` to prevent take-and-reject griefing.
- **Input length caps.** `query` 2 KB, `useCase` 4 KB, `webhookUrl` 2 KB.
  Indexer truncates third-party `description` to 4 KB.
- **Prompt-injection defense.** `composeStack` wraps untrusted content in
  delimiter tags and sanitizes closing-tag breakouts and code fences.
  System prompt instructs Claude to treat tagged content as data.

## Design decisions worth knowing

- **Embeddings:** Voyage `voyage-3-large` (1024-dim).
- **Vector search:** in-memory cosine across all rows. Fine up to ~50K
  offerings.
- **Claude:** Sonnet 4.6 with prompt caching on the system prompt.
- **Webhook delivery:** 5-second timeout, 3 retries (1s/4s/16s backoff).
  Per-request `X-Watch-Id` and `X-Alert-Number` headers,
  `User-Agent: TheMetaBot/1.0 (acp-watch)`.

## What's intentionally not in this shell

- No `sqlite-vss` extension (in-memory cosine is plenty at current scale)
- No HMAC signing on webhook payloads (deferred — buyer can supply a
  secret-bearing URL if they want auth)
- No EF Core (using classic ADO.NET per workspace convention)
- No Redis (per workspace convention)
- No tests — add per project as needed
